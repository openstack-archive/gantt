OpenStack Gantt README
=====================

Gantt provides a common scheduler framework for use by various
OpenStack components.

OpenStack Gantt is distributed under the terms of the Apache
License, Version 2.0. The full terms and conditions of this
license are detailed in the LICENSE file.

To keep updated with new developments in the OpenStack project
follow `@openstack <http://twitter.com/openstack>`_ on Twitter.

To learn how to deploy OpenStack, consult the documentation
available online at:

   http://docs.openstack.org

In the unfortunate event that bugs are discovered, they should
be reported to the appropriate bug tracker. If you obtained
the software from a 3rd party operating system vendor, it is
often wise to use their own bug tracker for reporting problems.
In all other cases use the master OpenStack bug tracker,
available at:

   http://bugs.launchpad.net/nova

Developers wishing to work on the OpenStack Gantt project should
always base their work on the latest Gantt code, available from
the master GIT repository at:

   http://github.com/openstack/gantt

Developers should also join the discussion on the mailing list,
at:

   http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack

Any new code must follow the development guidelines detailed
in the HACKING.rst file, and pass all unit tests. Further
developer focused documentation is available at:

   http://nova.openstack.org/
