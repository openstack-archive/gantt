OpenStack Gantt README
======================

Gantt provides a common scheduler framework for use by various
OpenStack components.

DISCLAIMER
**********

At the moment, the Gantt repository is a proof a concept for 
testing Nova scheduler split.
Don't consider Gantt as an active project. The content of this
Git repository will be fully resynchronized with Nova scheduler
code once the Nova scheduler forklift efforts are done.

the software from a 3rd party operating system vendor, it is

always base their work on the latest Gantt code, available from

Developers should also join the discussion on the mailing list,
at:

   http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack
