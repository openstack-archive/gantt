Code Reviews with Gerrit
========================

Nova uses the `Gerrit`_ tool to review proposed code changes. The review site
is http://review.openstack.org.

Gerrit is a complete replacement for Github pull requests. `All Github pull
requests to the Nova repository will be ignored`.

See `Gerrit Workflow Quick Reference`_ for information about how to get
started using Gerrit. See `Development Workflow`_ for more detailed
documentation on how to work with Gerrit.
